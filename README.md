# CCPS 109 Python Problems

## Concept Overview
The CCPS 109 Python Problems form a collection of 109 individual programming challenges designed for students taking the Computer Science I course at the Chang School of Continuing Education, Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada. These problems are curated by Ilkka Kokkarinen and are listed roughly in order of increasing complexity. Additionally, there are fourteen advanced bonus problems for students seeking a more challenging experience.

### Problem Characteristics
- **Scope:** The problems are designed to be solvable using only the core computation structures introduced in the first five weeks of the course.
- **Requirements:** Solutions should adhere to certain guidelines, such as using only the Python 3 standard library (excluding specialized libraries) and avoiding floating-point operations.
- **Implementation:** All solutions must be implemented in a single source code file named `labs109.py`. A provided tester script, `tester109.py`, allows students to validate their functions and track their progress in the course.

### Testing and Constraints
- **Efficiency:** Solutions should be efficient, with each individual function's test taking at most a couple of seconds to complete.
- **Precision:** Avoid floating-point operations to prevent issues with precision in test cases.
- **Silent Execution:** Functions should return the expected result silently without printing anything on the console. Debugging outputs are allowed during development but should be commented out before submission.

### Community and Discussion
- **Collaboration:** The emphasis is on collaboration and discussion at the idea level, fostering a supportive community among students.

### Acknowledgments
The problems are compiled from various sources, including past Java versions of the course, programming puzzle and code challenge sites, and recreational mathematics works. The author acknowledges the contributions of past students in uncovering errors and ambiguities, actively shaping the quality of the problem set.
