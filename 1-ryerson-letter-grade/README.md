# Ryerson Letter Grade Function

## Problem Description
Before the name change in the year 2022, Toronto Metropolitan University was known as Ryerson University. Given the percentage grade, calculate and return the letter grade that would appear in the Ryerson grades transcript, as defined on the [Ryerson Grade Scales](https://www.torontomu.ca/current-students/grades-standings/transcripts/legend/#!accordion-1616006999006-september-2013---present--all-faculties). This letter grade should be returned as a string that consists of the uppercase letter followed by the modifier '+' or '-', if there is one. This function should work correctly for all values of pct from 0 to 150.

## Implementation
The function `ryerson_letter_grade(pct)` can be implemented in various ways. One simple approach is to use an if-else ladder. The file [labs109.py](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems/blob/master/labs109.py) in the repository [ikokkari/PythonProblems](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems) already contains an implementation of this function. You can run the tester script [tester109.py](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems/blob/master/tester109.py) to verify that everything is working correctly.

## Additional Notes
As you learn more Python and techniques to make it dance for you, you may think up other ways to solve this problem. Some solutions may be appropriate for actual productive tasks in a professional coding environment, while others may be more of a conceptual performance art. The repository [ikokkari/PythonProblems](https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems) provides a platform for exploring different solutions to this problem.
